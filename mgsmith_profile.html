                    <p>League of Lengends has always been one of my favorite games. it is a five-on-five team fight that requires personal skil as well as team work.
                        Other games have<br> come and gone but for me League of Legends will always be the pinical gaming experience! Growing up as a young boy video games always facinated me. My<br>  family was never able
                        to purchase them ourselves so I would always watch my freinds play in envy. Now I am in a position that I am able to enjoy them in my free-time! </p>
